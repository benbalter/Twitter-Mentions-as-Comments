Twitter Mentions as Comments scours Twitter for people talking about your site & silently inserts their Tweets alongside your existing comments.

== Description ==

Twitter Mentions as Comments does exactly what it promises to do - scours Twitter for people talking about your blog posts and silently inserts their Tweets alongside your existing comments. The plugin leverages the power of WordPress's built-in commenting system - notification, comment moderation, author white/black listing - making Twitter an extension of your blog.

= Features =
* Searches for Tweets linking to your blog posts, regardless of the URL shortener used (using Twitter's Search API)
* Pushes Tweets into WordPress's existing comment workflow - notifications, comment moderation, and author whitelists/blacklists work just like any other comment
* Fetches user's real name and profile picture and links directly to the original Tweet
* Checks automatically - no need to do a thing
* Option to automatically exclude ReTweets
* Option to store tweets as trackbacks/pingbacks
* Option to specify which posts to check (e.g., 10 most recent posts, all posts, front page only)
* Smart Caching of Tweets and user data - retrieves only what it needs to save on API calls and server load

= Planned Features =
* Dynamic resizing of Twitter profile images to fit WordPress theme
* Prioritization of newer posts
* Oauth Authentication to raise API limit (currently unlimited Tweets, but limited to 150 *new* comment authors per hour)
* Smarter API throttling

You can see it in action on the [WP Resume Plugin page](http://ben.balter.com/2010/09/12/wordpress-resume-plugin/#comment-168).
